            <p>Almost every day we describe and assess the personalities of the people around us. "She has such a great personality," you might say about a friend. "He gets his personality from his dad," you might say about your rambunctious son. While we spend a lot of time talking about personality, many people are not quite sure exactly how and what personality psychology is really all about.


                Whether we realize it or not, these daily musings on how and why people behave as they do are similar to what personality psychologists do. While our informal assessments of personality tend to focus more on individuals, personality psychologists instead use conceptions of personality that can apply to everyone. Personality research has led to the development of a number of theories that help explain how and why certain personality traits develop.

                Let's take a closer look at exactly what psychologists mean when they talk about personality, how they study human personality, and some of the key theories of personality.
